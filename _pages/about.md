<!--Write your biography here. Tell the world about yourself. Link to your favorite [subreddit](http://reddit.com). You can put a picture in, too. The code is already in, just name your picture `prof_pic.jpg` and put it in the `img/` folder.

Put your address / P.O. box / other info right below your picture. You can also disable any these elements by editing `profile` property of the YAML header of your `_pages/about.md`. Edit `_bibliography/papers.bib` and Jekyll will render your [publications page](/al-folio/publications/) automatically.

Link to your social media connections, too. This theme is set up to use [Font Awesome icons](http://fortawesome.github.io/Font-Awesome/) and [Academicons](https://jpswalsh.github.io/academicons/), like the ones below. Add your Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Google Scholar, or just disable all of them. -->
<! -- subtitle:  <a href='#'>Post Doctoral Fellow, The von Karman Institute for Fluid Dynamics </a>. -->

I am a Post-doctoral fellow at the von Karman institute advised by [Dr. Piyush Rai](https://www.cse.iitk.ac.in/users/piyush/). I also closely collaborate with [Dr. Abhishek Kumar](http://www.abhishek.umiacs.io/) and [Dr. Hamim Zafar](https://hamimzafar.wixsite.com/home). 

My current research interests braodly lie in the study of Scalable Bayesian inference and Unsupervised deep representation learning. However, I am also interested in drawing ideas from the fields of computational cognitive science and Computational neuroscience to make current AI systems more robust.
